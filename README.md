Rarebit developer's library written in client-side javascript.

This library implements the Rarebit protocol, which is designed to enable collectible digital works to be issued and traded on the bitcoin network.

Using Rarebit client software, an artist or author can issue digitally signed limited editions of a work online, and collectors can trade units of the edition with the assurance they are authentic.
